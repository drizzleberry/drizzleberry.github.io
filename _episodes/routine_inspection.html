<p><br></p>
<p>Marty Kessler paced around his office. He had signed a lease five years ago for his third business venture, and the only one that would succeed: Northline Depot, an independent storage company. The lease had had a number of questionable terms written in fine print, but Marty was willing to overlook these for an affordable warehouse space. The building was slightly moldy, but it'd so far served his company well — for the most part, anyway.</p>
<p>One part of the lease he wasn't as fond of was the various "rights" and "privileges" reserved by the lessor, Mr. Hawthorne. He was your average landlord — greedy, cruel, and selfish, doing everything in his power to maintain an iron grip on Marty's business. His favorite way of doing so was invoking the "routine inspection" clause:</p>
<blockquote>
	<blockquote style="--page-paragraph-spacing: 1.000;">
		<p>Proprietor reserves the right to inspect the premises at reasonable intervals to ensure safety, compliance, and quality of functioning.</p>
	</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Normally, this wouldn't be that much of a problem — so far, Marty had survived every ding and write-up from Mr. Hawthorne's inspectors. Today's inspection would be a little different, though. Last week, the intern Jamie had discovered what they called "Item 847." It was a small piece of jewlery, but with the inexplicable power to knock the lights out of people and buildings alike. Whether it could do more was unclear — all Marty knew was that it wasn't something they could let out. He decided to safekeep the item in dark storage, locked up in a room behind his office — better there than in someone's apartment. Of course, that made it susceptible to another threat: the prospect of being taken by force. </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Any items not properly stored and recorded in the official warehouse inventory are considered abandoned, and may be seized by the landlord per right of salvage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully, it wouldn't come to that — someone like Mr. Hawthorne shouldn't know about something as powerful and unknowable as Item 847, let alone be able to get his slimy hands on it. Today, priority one was to keep 847 safe. After that, try not to lose <em>too</em> much money in fines. </p>
<p>The room was quiet, save for Marty's heartbeat. The calm before the storm. He took in deep breaths, running every situation through his head, and how he'd handle them with charm and grace. For now, all he could do was wait until the inspector arrived.</p>
<p>"Red alert, red alert, all hands on deck!" Tess burst into the room, her hair a tangled mess. "Marty, he's here! Mr. Caldon is at the front desk!"</p>
<p>"You could've just called my phone, Tess." He buttoned up his blazer, and donned his characteristic wide grin. "But now that you're here, I can tell you to get your ass to the processing zone. Today's one day we can't forget to sort our shipments."</p>
<p>Tess winked and saluted him with two fingers, dashing out the still-open door. Marty straightened his shirt and stepped out into the main warehouse, his stylish business casual standing out against the dull and dry storage interior. He made each step towards the lobby with purpose, reciting under his breath how he would greet the inspector to leave the perfect first impression of today's visit.</p>
<p>Deep breaths. No hesitation now.</p>
<p>"Morning, Mr. Caldon! I see you've already greeted our lovely receptionist, Ms. Jennings." Marty sauntered into the lobby, where the too-familiar face of Jonathan Caldon, the inspector, was standing across the desk from Nora. She was doing her best to maintain the aloofness that she typically used to get the other employees to stop pestering her — but Marty could see the anxiety in her eyes.</p>
<p>Mr. Caldon turned to Marty. "Been a while, Mr. Kessler. I've been waiting for longer than I'd like to be let into the building you're leasing." His voice had no hint of amity.</p>
<p>"Well, technically, you're already in the building, and—"</p>
<p>Mr. Caldon glared at Marty, dour eyes behind his glasses. Marty shriveled up.<br><br>"Okay, point is, I'm here now, and this time we've made sure everything's in tip-top condition!" He gestured for Mr. Caldon to enter the storage area; the stone-faced man pushed directly past him, forcing his way through the door. </p>
<p>"I hope you know, Mr. Kessler, that these inspections from Mr. Hawthorne are to evaluate both your company's adherence to standard regulations, <em>and</em> how effective your business is."</p>
<p>"Ah, uh, of course! Luckily, Northline has been doing <em>great</em> since your last visit." Marty braced his teeth, forcing his smile to hold shape. "I'm sure you remember our storage area. It's where we hold all our—"</p>
<p>"I'm more interested in the reason you store decommissioned heavy machinery occupying this otherwise unused area."</p>
<p>Marty winced as Mr. Caldon examined the giant, fallen-over forklift, which lay on its side like a massive, dying beast.  <em>I thought I told Darrell to fix it before the inspection?</em></p>
<p>"Ah, yes. It's, uh, currently undergoing maintenance — safety first, and all that. I believe it's an OSHA Class Four?"</p>
<p>"Mmm. Luckily, I'm not with OSHA. We'll see if this violates any terms of the lease." Mr. Caldon pulled a pen from his shirt pocket, and scribbled a note on his yellow legal pad. Marty pretended not to look. <em> </em></p>
<p>"Right, ah, on with the tour!"</p>
<p>"Mr. Kessler, I assure you, I have no need for a—"</p>
<p>"Tut-tut!" Marty held a finger up to him. "At Northline Depot, our guests are a top priority. Allow me the honor."<br><br>Mr. Caldon grumbled, following Marty as the latter marched off toward the aisles. The spine of the warehouse was a 70-foot-long concourse, lit by flickering yellow lights hanging from an exposed ceiling. To each side were six lofty metal shelves — a closer look revealed that each of the 24 total aisles were numbered by a sheet of ledger paper duct-taped to the side and scrawled on in Sharpie. The shelves were double-wide, ensuring that each could be packed tightly with as many random crates and pallets as could fit.</p>
<p>None of this was news to Mr. Caldon — it was something he had accepted over his many encounters with Marty and his business.</p>
<p>"Alright, Mr. Kessler, if you insist on being my guide, then I'd like you to show me around gour inventory. As you're well aware, we check to ensure all items are stored properly and have appropriate documentation, or else—"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, I know," Marty interrupted, before Mr. Caldon could remind him of the penalties. "Why don't we start with Aisle 1 here?"</p>
<p>Marty surveyed the disorganized mess adorning the shelves — children's crayons next to clearance kitchenware, defunct electronics next to outdated designer bags. There was zero rhyme or reason to the way anything was stored. </p>
<p>"We use this one as our ease-of-access aisle. The storage market is fluid, y'know. We're always moving things here and there, and that's why our front aisles are for storing the things that won't be staying for long." All of this was a complete lie. Marty never made his employees organize the shelves — that was Darrell's job to oversee, and for all he knew, Darrell could've had it sorted alphabetically.</p>
<p>"This looks like a mess."</p>
<p>Marty waved his hand. "Oh, that's by design."</p>
<p>"Mmm. I see."</p>
<p>"Trust me. I've been doin' this for five years."</p>
<p>Fortunately, Mr. Caldon deferred to Marty's wisdom as a successful warehouse operator. Marty breathed a sigh of relief, as the inspector marched off to the next aisle.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center">…</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A collared shirt and orange vest were what Darrell wore every day to work. He kept the same no-nonsense attitude about him at all times. Work at Northline was serious, and though this attitude may have caused the others to give him strange looks, it was also why he'd been made the foreman. While Marty was always bouncing around and swindling in their most valuable customers, Darrell had to handle the more important kind of business — the day-to-day work of making sure the warehouse ran smoothly so it wouldn't fall into ruin. </p>
<p>One could imagine what would've happened when a man even more gruff and humorless than Darrell approached him.</p>
<p>"Greetings, Mr. Caldon." Darrell clenched his teeth.</p>
<p>"Mmm." The inspector walked straight past him, squinting at the heavy boxes resting on the shelves behind.</p>
<p>Darrell inhaled sharply. "Would you like me to, uh, explain what those are?" Mr. Caldon was closely examining a pallet of wide, flat-packed boxes containing a variety of ready-to-assembly furniture. Everything was arranged neatly, though people like Marty wouldn't understand his methods.</p>
<p>"No thank you, Mr…" Mr. Caldon had apparently forgotten Darrell's name since his last time.</p>
<p>"Briggs. Darrell Briggs."</p>
<p>"Right." He straightened his glasses. "Mr. Briggs, I'm aware you play a critical role this whole operation."</p>
<p>Darrell lifted his chin. <em>Finally, someone recognizes my work. </em></p>
<p>"Which is why I'd like to ask," he continued, "why the emergency exit by aisle 12 is obstructed with so much clutter. I'm sure a man like you is aware of the non-compliance with lease policy." He stared at Darrell impatiently. </p>
<p>The foreman furrowed his eyebrows. "We're in the process of re-organizing that aisle. Excuse our mess."</p>
<p>"So you understand that this oversight poses a liability to the property, despite having had ample time to prepare for this assessment."</p>
<p>"Our work at Northline doesn't pause for inspectors."</p>
<p>"Your work isn't up to par."</p>
<p>Darrell's jaw tightened. "Mr. Inspector, I'd ask how many storage companies from whom you have managed, but I believe I already know the answer." He scowled, marching off to attend to further business. He glanced back just once to see Mr. Caldon jot on his notepad. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center">…</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><br></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">"Hey, hey! My name's Tess, and this is our processing zone." She beamed, gesturing widely to the pallets and boxes the employees had spent yesterday randomly placing in neat square rows. </p>
<p>"Mis—" Mr. Caldon paused, unsure of whether the short-haired young adult before him was male or female. "Uh, Tess, yes. I'm hope your processing zone is all in order."</p>
<p>"I hope so too," she grinned. "Care if I show you around?"</p>
<p>"Actually, I do care. I'll have a look myself. Continue doing…" He looked Tess up and down. "…Whatever it is you people do." Tess stepped back as Mr. Caldon strode off to examine the pallets and crates stacked carefully around the room just hours earlier. He glanced past a few of them — others, he tapped on, lifted, or looked closely at the labels. As much as Tess was on edge from this inspector with the power to shut down their business, she was also somewhat impressed at how Mr. Caldon could assess a box just by touching it in a few places.</p>
<p>"You," he growled to her. "Tell me, what is this?" It was a heavy machine of some sort resting on a pallet. Tess had no idea what it actually was, but she wasn't going to admit that. </p>
<p>"Ah, that's a, uh, washing machine motor." <em>What do washing machine motors look like?</em></p>
<p>"It's bigger than a washing machine. Three times bigger."</p>
<p> "Could be a big washing machine?"</p>
<p>"I ask because it's labeled 'Appliances — Light Load', which is demonstrably incorrect."</p>
<p>"Oh, um, yeah. I'm not sure what's up with that. The label has been there since it arrived."</p>
<p>"I see." He scribbled on his notepad. "Just noticing a pattern, is all." As he put the pad in his coat, Tess saw him glance toward a stack of pallets in the far end of the area. An unusually tall one at that. A small fire sprinkler was above it — the only one in the room.</p>
<p>She noticed his eyes moving up and down, calculating. <em>Measuring.</em> The sprinkler was mere inches away the dust on top of the highest crate. Her heart jumped. </p>
<p><em>They're too close. Way too close.</em></p>
<p>She darted right beside Mr. Caldon, who already had his notepad out. "Hey, uh, sir! Mr. Caldon!" He swiveled around in mild surprise, lowering his pen.</p>
<p>"Um." She fidgeted. "Would you like to uh, get a coffee?"</p>
<p>He raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"Like, in our break room. Have you seen it yet? We just got a new coffee machine," she lied. "You must be pretty tired after, like, a whole two hours of looking at boxes."</p>
<p>He scowled for a moment, before his eyes softened a little. "Actually, yes," he said, "that would be nice."</p>
<p><br></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center">…</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><br></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Silas didn't really like talking to people. Sure, he would sweep the floors or check the lights when Darrell or Marty told him to, but he was happiest when he was left to his own devices. It didn't help that any time someone wanted to talk to him, they were always being annoying. Right now, he was taking the trash out, not because it was full but because he needed to pretend to be doing his job as a maintenance keeper to justify his fifteen an hour wage.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">"Mr. Trent, do you have the keys to the electrical closet?"</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The person currently barging into his personal space and time was a vaguely familiar face. Someone important, probably.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">"Yeah."</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Mr. Caldon swept his jacket lightly. "Let me rephrase. May I <em>borrow</em> the keys to the electrical closet?"</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">"Oh." Silas didn't look up. "No." <em>Idiot.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">"Mr. Trent, I'm not sure if you know this, but I am inspecting the warehouse. Please give me the keys so I can examine the electrical closet."</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">"Don't feel like it." </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">He cleared his throat loudly. "I was told by Mr. Kessler that you are in possession of the keys. I'd encourage you to hand them over."</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">At the mention of Marty's name, Silas finally gave in. He fiddled with the carabiner on his belt, pulling out a chain with several keys. "Think it's the shiny one," he mumbled. "Don't know what the others do." He handed the keys to Mr. Caldon, but the inspector just glared at him.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">"How about you <em>show</em> me which one opens the closet?"</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A moment later, Silas was shambling as slow as he cared to with the keys in hand, Mr. Caldon's cold breath on his neck. He abruptly came to a stop in front of a heavy door. "DANGER —" it read, "ELECTRICAL CLOSET." </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">"Open it."</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">"Alright, alright, don't make this a big deal." He shoved a silver key slightly less rusty than the others into the lock. After a bit of idle fiddling, the door clicked and swung inward. Mr. Caldon wasted no time striding into the closet to check every detail with unreasonable precision. Silas idly watched as each panel and meter was meticulously examined for any minute flaw that the inspector would presumably note down, in his unrelenting spite for Northline. <em>Can't believe this bum gets paid twice as much as me.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">"This circuit board is completely fried. How long has it been like that?"</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">"Don't know. Might've been that power surge a couple days ago."</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">"What power surge?"</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">"The hell are you talking about? The power surged. What do you want?"</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Mr. Caldon scowled. "I would recommend you replace it soon. I'm sure you understand this is a severe fire hazard." </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">He wrote something down on his notepad. Silas noticed that he had filled nearly two pages, in all likelihood with unending complaints and nitpicks about the work they do. After a brief moment of relief where Mr. Caldon kept his mouth shut to examine the closet further, he came back to Silas with yet another complaint.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">"I'm also noticing a lack of an AED."</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">"Haven't had an incident so far." Silas did his best not to groan at this asswipe. </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">"The regulation to avoid liability is at least one installed per building floor."</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">"Shame." Silas jangled the keys in his hands. "S'pose I should get back to work," he grunted, shuffling out of sight before Mr. Caldon could object.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><br></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center">…</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><br></p>
<p>Marty dashed down the main cross-aisle, racing after Mr. Caldon. He caught up behind him, straightening and brushing down his blazer. "Looks like I lost track of you for a bit," he panted.</p>
<p>"I wish I'd lost track of you."</p>
<p>Marty forced a chuckle as he walked behind Mr. Caldon, looking over his shoulder at the notepad. Two full pages had been filled with assorted complaints and gripes about Northline Depot. The blocked fire exit, the over-stacked boxes, and definitely the fallen-over forklift — all damning implications for the business, and all glimmering nails to Mr. Caldon's inspection hammer. Marty's plan was working, and it looked like Mr. Caldon would be taking his leave.</p>
<p>"Anyways, now that my lovely hard-working employees have given you the rundown, I suppose you'd better be going."</p>
<p>Mr. Caldon didn't make eye contact. He came to a stop in front of a locked wooden door. </p>
<p>"Not quite, Mr. Kessler. I noted that the leased square footage of this warehouse doesn't quite match the declared storage space." He turned to Marty, nodding to the door. "I have reason to believe there's something you're not telling me."</p>
<p>Marty's chest tightened. That door was to his office — and behind it, the dark storage where Item 847 was kept. If Mr. Caldon found it, god forbid discovered what it did, there wouldn't be much stopping him from taking it straight to Mr. Hawthorne. But there was no lying to the inspector, not if Marty didn't want the warehouse to face tenant penalties. </p>
<p>"Of course not, sir." A nervous laugh escaped his mouth. "This is just my office." He unlocked the door and motioned for Mr. Caldon to enter. </p>
<p>A wide, wooden desk with a couple of chairs around it, a few filing cabinets, and a shelf of various books and trinkets furnished Marty's office. None of it was as particular of interest to Mr. Caldon, however, as the presence of a second locked door within the office. "RESTRICTED ACCESS — CLIENT PROPERTY."</p>
<p>"So yeah, that's my office. Nothing special, but it is something of a home for me."</p>
<p>Mr. Caldon ignored him. "Mr. Kessler," he growled, "what is behind that door?"</p>
<p>Marty smiled through clenched teeth. "Oh, uh, nothing important. Just a storage closet."</p>
<p>"I see. So you're keeping undisclosed property."</p>
<p>"Ah, of course not. In fact we're fully willing to disclose," he breathed, "what we're storing." Mr. Caldon's icy stare was locked directly on him as he fumbled his keys into the lock. </p>
<p><em>Click.</em></p>
<p>The dark storage room wasn't actually dark — but it wasn't exactly well-lit either. A single overhead light, of cheap fluorescent kind, hung an uncomfortable seven feet above a series of three medium-size metal shelves. Scattered on the floor were cardboard boxes, a couple of crates, and some items stored with no packaging at all.</p>
<p>"This is where we keep client property that's too secure or easily damaged to store in the main storage area."</p>
<p>"Noted, Mr. Kessler."</p>
<p>Mr. Caldon wasted no time getting to work. He prowled around the room with his notepad in hand, looking closely at the labels of each package. Even in the dim lighting, each box was given a thorough look. He scanned the shelves, too — no detail was passed over as he examined every item on every rack. Marty swallowed as he continued, slowly, meticulously, creeping closer and closer to the small case where Item 847 lay. Marty clenched his fists to stop them from shaking as Mr. Caldon approached the rearmost shelf where the case had been places. If he opened the case, it would be over. He stood paralyzed as Mr. Caldon closed in like a lion going for the kill, disappearing behind the rack in front…</p>
<p>"KESSLER! Are you storing—"</p>
<p>"I can explain!"</p>
<p>"—lithium batteries in unsafe conditions?!"</p>
<p>Marty blinked. "Wait, what?"</p>
<p>"Need I repeat myself? Your company is storing dozens of junkyard lithium ion batteries on <em>metal shelves</em>! Do you even <em>know</em> how dangerous that is?  If a battery terminal touches the shelves for even a <em>second</em>, hundreds of amps will start surging, through one of your damn employees if they're poor enough to touch it! And that's not even mentioning the fire risk — are you out of your <em>mind</em>, Mr. Kessler?"</p>
<p>The blood slowly returned to Marty's face. "Oh, I — um." </p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>"We, uh, didn't realize the risk was so high," he stammered.</p>
<p>"The regulations clearly warn about lithium storage. This is sheer idiocy at best. The amount of risk here means that these batteries cannot be stored here legally.You have the choice of disposing of them today via a third-party, or we will arrange for seizure."</p>
<p>Marty let out a long, shuddering sigh. "We'll call the fire department."</p>
<p>He could tell through Mr. Caldon's glower that he was satisfied. The inspector's eyes did a final pass over the room, his eyes skimming right over the case where Item 847 was — just another box of junk compared to the batteries.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center">…</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As Marty and Mr. Caldon walked back toward the front office, Marty's shirt was soaked with sweat under his blazer. Marty escorted Mr. Caldon back toward the front office, his head low — waiting for the second shoe to drop.</p>
<p>"So, what's gonna happen to Northline?"</p>
<p>"You know, Mr. Kessler, a lot of business managers whose properties I examine try <em>hiding</em> things from me…"</p>
<p><em>Did he see it? Does he know?</em></p>
<p>"…But you and your employees are upfront about your mistakes. That is something I can commend you for. As a result, I'll waive any potential penalties." </p>
<p>Marty's shoulders were still tense as they entered the front office. Mr. Caldon paused at the glass double doors, reaching into his shirt pocket for his pen. He looked Marty up and down, taking in the trembling hands, wide eyes, and frantic energy from the Northline owner.</p>
<p>"You are an unusual tenant, Mr. Kessler. Nevertheless," he sighed, "your warehouse remains operational. Have a good day."</p>
