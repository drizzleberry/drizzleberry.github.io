<p>Nothing ever happens at Northline Depot.</p>
<p>I’ve been working as an intern at this hole-in-the-wall warehouse for nearly two months, and I can say with full confidence — it’s the least exciting place in the county. Unless, of course, your idea of fun involves stacking crates and inhaling dust.</p>
<p>Speaking of inhaling dust, that's exactly what I'm doing. Not on purpose, of course, just as a side task while moving boxes around. For some reason, the foreman, Darrell, has decided that today is the day we're finally going to reorganize aisle 17. And by we, I mean me, because I'm the one doing all the actual work, since he's my 'superior' or whatever and needs to boss me around.</p>
<p>There's a towering pile of cardboard boxes stacked haphazardly against one of the shelves, a monument of unsorted, unclaimed packages from the last twenty years — long before this company even started running. Going through these boxes is like going through a time machine — one powered by manual labor and incessant clipboard tapping. One makes the sound of jangling keys; another has the unmistakable scent of old textbooks. I recoil when one of them makes a horrifying sound of scraping on stainless steel. I can't help but wonder what's within the more ambiguous ones, like the box that sounds like it has liquid sloshing around inside. But I can't look too close at any of them without getting Darrell's stink eye, let alone actually open them.</p>
<p>By the hour, what was once a six-foot tall mountain of miscellaneous materials has now become a meek stack of only three or four; everything else is stacked neatly into shelves they probably don't belong in, or carefully carted off to other, similar piles. I reach for one of the last boxes — it's pretty small, nestled between a couple of larger ones. I set it down beside me, and yell out to Darrell.</p>
<p>"Hey, Mr. Darrell! Where's this one go?"</p>
<p>He doesn't answer. Also, the annoying tapping has stopped. </p>
<p>I turn around, and Darrell isn't there at all. Reflexively, I pull my phone out of my back pocket. <em>12:00. </em>Darrell never takes a minute off of his lunch break.</p>
<p>Fine, whatever. I'll figure out where this box goes myself.</p>
<p>Picking up the box, I turn it over in my hands, looking for packaging labels or information that would tell me what's inside it, and where it might go. Weirdly, it's completely lacking any labels or shipping codes — the only thing distinctive about it is  the number "847," scrawled in permanent marker. Maybe that number carries some meaning to Darrell, but it's nothing I recognize. The box is light, too — for all I know, it could be filled entirely with packing peanuts. The rustling as I shake it seems to confirm that theory. </p>
<p>Normally, I wouldn't give a rat's ass about a random cardboard box. But this one feels… different. It <em>is</em> different, in a way. This box has probably been collecting dust for twenty years, and I'm the first person to give it an actual <em>look</em>. That's why I don't think twice about tearing open the packaging tape to see what's inside. </p>
<p>My fingernails go straight through the slit where the tape holds the flaps together, cleaving through it as cleanly as any box cutter. The bubble wrap inside is cleanly folded over on itself, encasing the contents in sheets of wrinkly plastic film. I neatly remove the packaging, revealing what's inside…</p>
<p>…Another box. Incredible. It's black, maybe five or six inches across, with a texture like that plastic substitute for velvet. My better judgment tells me that whatever this is, we're being paid to store it and not ask questions — what I'm doing now is practically the direct opposite of that. But at this point, it's kinda too late to be having doubts; the box is already open. I pry open the golden latch, lifting up the lid and exposing to air a small piece of jewelry.</p>
<p>It's nothing extraordinary, nor very valuable-looking, but it'd be a lie to say it wasn't beautiful. A thin, silver chain rests on the fabric-lined bottom of the box, holding a small, spherical crystal pendant. Almost automatically, I remove the necklace, gingerly holding it up to the light. The sunbeams hitting the pendant dance across its surface and between its delicate crystalline lattices, creating the illusion of swirling clouds and flowing waves. I can see crackling flames that dissipate into towering mountains against the backdrop of dark, starlit skies. My mind is filled with grand temples and ancient ruins, whispering voices and shadowy figures, pillars upon which incomprehensible beings are seated — countless scenes from secret and fantastical worlds intersecting into an embroidery of that which is otherworldly yet nonetheless very real.</p>
<p>Then it all goes dark.</p>

<p style="text-align: center" align="center">…</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><br></p>
<p style="text-align: left">I awaken to the sound of voices conversing over the faint buzzing that constantly permeates the warehouse. I'm staring up at the break room ceiling. My head and back are sore, but I sit up anyway on the floor. The other employees are chatting around the room.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">"Yeah, the inspector told us last time we need to have auxiliary power, but frankly, we barely have enough to pay for our <em>regular</em> power."</p>
<p style="text-align: left">It's Marty, the owner.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">"Has anyone— Oh, Jamie! You're awake." He turns to me. I stand up, before realizing that I'm most likely in trouble for… whatever it is I did that landed me passed out on the break room floor. Also in the room are Darrell and Nora, the receptionist.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">"A circuit breaker tripped, and the whole building went dark," Marty explains. "Apparently all the lights are on one circuit. While Darrell was looking around for a flashlight to reset the circuit box, he found you sleeping on the floor. Brought you back here, along with a 100-watt flashlight. Y'know, those things could probably start forest fires." He chuckles.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">"Anyways, why'd you pass out? Anything to do with the outage?"</p>
<p style="text-align: left">I hesitate. "Uh…"</p>
<p style="text-align: left">"Eh, it's whatever. Darrell shouldn't be leaving you unattended anyway." Marty laughs and grabs a paper cup of coffee from the counter. He obviously doesn't know about the pendant — not that I really know what happened either. Maybe I need to see a psychiatrist. Marty sips his coffee and shoos us out of the room.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">"I'm not paying you to loaf around, y'know."</p>
<p style="text-align: left">The other two shuffle out of the room, with Darrell giving me a backwards glance before leaving. I linger back with Marty for a moment.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">"Hey, Mr. Kessler?"</p>
<p style="text-align: left">"Oh, Jamie, no one here calls me 'Mister.' Just 'Marty' is fine. 'Martin,' if you're a client."</p>
<p style="text-align: left">"Well, Marty, I just wanted to let you know that, uh, I found something in a box."</p>
<p style="text-align: left">"Mmmhm. Boxes tend to be like that. Lots of stuff inside."</p>
<p style="text-align: left">"Yeah, well, the box wasn't labeled, and it was buried under a bunch of other stuff." I explain to him how I opened the box, found the crystal pendant, and had all those graphic visions. He nods as I speak, his smile slowly fading into seriousness. "I think that's when the power went out, but I'm not sure. I passed out right after."</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Marty's stonewalled face breaks back into his characteristic grin. "Well, that's just how things are, full of surprises, y'know. Why don't you go help Darrell — the unloading bay isn't going to sort itself."</p>
<p style="text-align: left">I shrug and walk out. Maybe it's not that unusual after all. But before I close the door behind me, Marty calls out to me.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">"By the way, Jamie. If you, ah, see the pendant you were talking about, just give it to me. So I can deal with it."</p>
<p style="text-align: left">I nod. The door slams behind me.</p>
