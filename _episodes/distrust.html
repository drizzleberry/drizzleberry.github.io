<p>"Nora, can I help with the catalog?"</p>

<p>Nora doesn't look up from her computer behind the desk. "What do you mean, help?"</p>

<p>I quickly realize that I don't know anything about office work. The only thing I've ever helped Nora with is fixing the coffee machine.</p>

<p>"Well, like, making sure all the stuff we moved earlier is properly indexed."</p>

<p>She stops typing and straightens her glasses. "Actually, I do need to get that done. I could use some help."</p>

<p>My lips upturn at their corners. This is my chance.</p>

<p>She rummages through her desk, producing a clipboard from a drawer. "Could you index all the items you moved and their new locations? Ask Darrell for help if you need to."</p>

<p>
    I quickly run my eyes up and down the clipboard's blank ruled sheets, before looking back to Nora. I open to speak, but she's already back to tapping at her keyboard.
    <em>Well, there goes that plan.</em>
    I quietly retreat to the warehouse interior, taking the clipboard with me.
</p>

<p>
    I plod through the building, looking up at the 10-foot-tall metal shelves stuffed with random boxes and wooden pallets.
    <em>I need to find that pendant.</em>
    I don't know where it went, but my best guess is that Marty had Darrell shelve it somewhere where it wouldn't attract attention — either that, or one of those two pocketed it for themselves.
    I don't trust anyone around here to give me a straight answer, and I definitely can't search all 21 aisles myself.
</p>

<p>
    Why do I need to find it? Well, not to keep for myself. It just — I don't know, it feels
    <em>wrong</em>.
    Like something that doesn't belong in a box collecting dust, or hanging around someone's neck without them knowing what it even is. Granted, it's not like
    <em>I</em>
    know what it is. The only thing I know for sure about it is that it messes with your mind — and maybe it's still doing so to me. Regardless, I need to figure out what's up with the crystal pendant, and then I can figure out what my next step will be.
</p>

<p>I check the time on my phone. It's 3:58 PM. My muscles relax a little bit — the last shipment of today should be in any minute now.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p style="text-align: center" align="center">…</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
    I pop into the processing zone, a shed area near the back of the warehouse littered with unsorted deliveries stacked on wooden pallets. Weaving between the disordered crates, I approach the heavy chain that opens the bulkhead door. As I haul the steel gate open, the building is filled with the washed out yellow of afternoon light.
    Sure enough, the delivery truck is pulling in, not a minute early or late.
</p>

<p>
    The pungent scent of gasoline exhaust fills my nostrils. The truck door swings open, and a strong, sturdy woman smoothly climbs out and onto the gravel. Dust from the landing kicks up onto her gray jeans.
</p>

<p>"Tess?"</p>
<p>"Jamie! How's it goin'?"</p>
<p>"Uhh, it's alright. As alright as things can be in this shithole."</p>

<p>
    Tess laughs, brushing her dirty blonde mop away from her eyes. "What's with the welcome-back party?"
</p>

<p>
    "Well," I begin, "I actually wanted to talk to you about something that happened earlier today."
</p>

<p>
    "Of course!" She's crouched over, fumbling with the fastening on the back of the truck. She turns the handle, and the doors unlatch. "But first, we have some shipments to take in."
</p>

<p>I sigh before smiling. Can't escape work around here.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p style="text-align: center" align="center">…</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
    It's a good half hour of moving heavy cardboard boxes from the truck's cargo box to the processing zone — Tess and I made sure to carefully dump them all over the place for Darrell to organize later. And by Darrell, I mean me, because I've never seen Darrell do any work of his own.
</p>

<p>
    The two of us are now sitting down — Tess on a wooden pallet, myself on a crate that probably can't actually hold my weight. She looks around blankly, before something clicks.
</p>

<p>
    "Oh, right — you wanted to tell me something?"<br><br>
    I nod. "It was earlier today, during lunch break. Darrell was making me reorganize aisle 17…"
    I explain to Tess in lengthy detail about how I found the crystal pendant, and what happened after. The visions swirling through my head, the heat rushing through my skin down to my bones, the cold hard ground that I woke up on.
</p>

<p>
    "Hmm." She stares at the ground, mulling it over. "Probably magic. Couldn't say for sure."
</p>

<p>"Magic isn't real, Tess."</p>
<p>"Yeah, it is. I—"</p>
<p>"You already told me about the flying pig."</p>
<p>"I wasn't gonna bring up the flying pig! I was gonna tell you about this other time, I had a mug of coffee and it slid across the table like three inches without me doing anything."</p>
<p>"This is serious, Tess!"</p>

<p>
    "I <em>know</em> it's serious! Listen, listen." She pauses, taking a deep breath.
    "Look, you saw with your very own eyes something that was not normal. Whatever you wanna call it, it actually happened and was not a figment of your imagination, correct?"
    <br><br>
    "Yeah." I narrow my eyes slightly.
</p>

<p>
    "Well, regardless of whether you think
    <em>I'm</em>
    crazy, I'm the only one who
    <em>won't</em>
    think
    <em>you're</em>
    crazy if you tell them you found a magic necklace that made you hallucinate and faint. We both know that's why you came to me."
    She stands up. At her standing height, her eyes are quite above my own as I'm still sitting.
</p>

<p>
    "So we're going to find this crystal pendant, and prove that you're
    <em>not</em>
    crazy. And we're going to find it using diplomacy."
</p>

<p>
    Tess grins at me. I smile back and stand up — now a couple of inches higher than her.
</p>

<p>"Alright then," I say, "what's your idea?"</p>

<p><br></p>

<p style="text-align: center" align="center">…</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
    Nora is still clacking away on the keyboard at the front desk when Tess and I barge in from the employee-side door.
    She ignores our presence, presumably with her supernatural sense that tells her whether someone at the desk is important or not.
</p>

<p>"Hey, Nora! Got a question for you," Tess says.</p>

<p>Nora continues to stare at her computer. "Ask away."</p>

<p>
    "So, uh," I mumble a little bit, before gaining control over my words.
    "I was indexing the items we moved earlier today, and what I found was that there's uh, a box missing. We think someone might have misplaced it."
</p>

<p>
    I tap the clipboard she gave me earlier, expecting a response.
</p>

<p>
    She looks up at me for a moment, before speaking. "Well, I wouldn't know about it, but you're welcome to check the catalog to see if someone indexed its new location."
    She glances at us, tapping her finger on the desk.
</p>

<p>
    Tess and I grin at one another. "And where could we access the catalog?" I ask.
</p>

<p>
    Nora rotates her swivel chair to a file cabinet. She pulls the drawer open, pulling out a stapled sheaf of several papers.
</p>

<p>
    "Here. Be responsible with it. That includes you too, Tess."
</p>

<p>
    Tess beams back at Nora. "Yes ma'am."
</p>

<p>
    Nora hands me the papers, and the two of us quickly retreat through the door to the break room before she questions our motivations.
</p>

<p>
    The break room is furnished with a table and a couple of plastic chairs scattered around it. There's a counter with a sink and microwave. A small fridge is in the back corner.
    I slap the bundle of papers on the table, and pull up a chair. Tess does the same.
</p>

<p>
    I turn to Tess. "Now that your master plan has been executed," I say, "Is the plan just to skim through the entire catalog and see if it's actually logged in here?"
</p>

<p>
    "I dunno. I was hoping Nora would just tell us. But if it's
    <em>not</em>
    in here, that's also useful info, if you know what I'm saying."
</p>

<p>
    "I suppose you're right." I look at the first sheet.
    It reads <strong>Northline Depot: Catalog of Inventory</strong>.
    I've never actually seen the whole thing — whenever I have to take inventory, all I get is the clipboard with its blank sheets, which presumably ends up being logged in Nora's spreadsheet somehow.
    The page is meticulously organized by aisle, client, and quantity.
</p>

<p>
    Tess leans over my shoulder as I flip through the pages for aisle 1, then aisle 2, and so on, scanning for anything about jewelry or accessories that could match what I'm looking for.
    Complete collection of a children's book series, aisle 4.
    <em>Not what I need.</em>
    Two barrels of hazardous chemicals, aisle 9.
    <em>Definitely not what I need.</em>
    Old invoices from a company that they didn't want shredded. Clothing stock that's out of season. Six boxes of a new toaster model. Over 200 packs of frozen tortillas.
</p>

<p>
    "Wow," I say, "we store a
    <em>lot</em>
    of random bullshit."
</p>

<p>
    "Well, that's kinda the industry we're in. Holding onto other companies' garbage until they need it distributed to retailers."
</p>

<p>
    There are
    <em>some</em>
    jewelry items listed in the catalog. Most of it is in bulk, though — dead stock from previous seasons, mass-produced items that they have too much of, cheap accessories that they give away for free.
    Nothing that would require more security than what our company can provide by disguising it among thousands of identical boxes.
    There's definitely no mention of the small, velvety container that had the crystal pendant necklace.
    I also look through aisle 17's entire inventory, this time with careful scrutiny — there's nothing mentioning the box I found, the one marked "#847."
</p>

<p>
    Tess slumps back in her chair. "What a waste of time—"
</p>

<p>
    The door creaks open, followed by the slightly too familiar sound of work boots tapping the tile floor.
    Darrell walks right past the two of us, beelining for the fridge — he always keeps his lunch inside.
    Right when he's about to take his things and leave for the day, however, he turns to us and raises an eyebrow.
</p>

<p>"What are you two up to?"</p>

<p>
    My heart rate picks up, but Tess stays cool.
    "We're just making sure the catalog is up to date. Nora asked."
    I nod silently in concurrence.
</p>

<p>
    Darrell squints at us briefly, before his eyes relax.
    "Hrm."
    He walks out through the door, clocking out for the day.
</p>

<p>
    I sigh. "Close call."
</p>

<p>
    "Eh, not really. Darrell's not usually that interested in scrutinizing people."
</p>

<p>
    "Huh. In my experience, he's the exact opposite."
</p>

<p>
    Tess checks the time on her watch. It's steel, manly, and has about three different smaller dials that probably measure useless things like barometric pressure.
    It
    <em>is</em>
    damn cool, though — just like the rest of her.
</p>

<p>
    "We should really get going," she says. "There's nothing in this shitty catalog — plus, Nora will be heading home soon, so she's gonna snatch it back anyway."
</p>

<p>
    "Yeah, I guess you're right. What now, though? Don't we have to go home, too?"
</p>

<p>
    "Oh, Jamie, we don't
    <em>have</em>
    to leave — we certainly can, but Marty certainly isn't going to object to us 'working overtime.' And speaking of which, my next plan was to stop by his office."
</p>

<p>
    After we return the catalog to Nora, who doesn't even acknowledge us, we make our way over to the other end of the depot.
    Today has been a lot of running back and forth.
    Cutting between the tall metal shelves, we find ourselves at the door to Marty's office.
</p>

<p>
    Tess tries the handle. It's locked.
</p>

<p>
    "S'pose we should knock."
</p>

<p>
    I nod and tap the wooden door twice with my fist.
</p>

<p>"Come in!"</p>
<p>"Marty, it's locked!" Tess yells back.</p>
<p>"One second!"</p>

<p>
    From inside the room, there's the sound of creaking, followed by footsteps, something loudly hitting the floor, an audible expletive, and then more footsteps.
    The door swings inwards, and Marty Kessler is on the other side. He wears a white polo shirt, khaki trousers, and a toothy grin he often uses before hustling a customer.
</p>

<p>"Jamie, Tess. What can I do for you two?"</p>

<p>"Well, uh…"</p>

<p>
    "Actually," Tess spoke, letting herself into the office, "we were hoping to have a little chat with you about something."
</p>

<p>
    Marty stumbles. "Ah, of course! Take a seat."
</p>

<p>
    Tess motions for me to take the lounge chair facing the desk, while she rolls up a swivel chair from the corner.
    Marty seats himself in his office chair behind the desk, and folds his arms across the table top.
</p>

<p>"Well, I'm all ears."</p>

<p>
    "I, uh. Well, I—" I fumble to get what I want to say out.
    My mind flails about, grasping for the words to be assertive, but not be outright demanding of the company owner.
    Pausing, I take a deep breath in.
    "So. When the power went out, I told you I had found a strange box with a crystal pendant inside."
</p>

<p>
    "You don't need to remind me! It was just a few hours ago, y'know."
    He chuckles.
</p>

<p>
    "Right, so, I'm wondering if you know what happened to it. You shrugged it off when I initially told you about it, but now it's missing — I'm wondering if someone stole it, or hid it somewhere."
</p>

<p>
    He frowns. "I don't follow."
</p>

<p>
    "Well, you're the only person I told about what happened, since I figured you would know what to do.
    But now it's gone, and I'm suspicious that someone shelved it away or pocketed it, when what we
    <em>should</em>
    be doing is figuring out what it does so we can safely handle it."
</p>

<p>
    Marty’s frown is replaced by a grimace. He inhales deeply.
    "Look, kid, it's not a big deal. It's just a piece of jewelry, and you freaked out. The outage was a coincidence. Maybe you ate something weird that day, I don't know. Just stop worrying about it."
</p>

<p>
    I sigh. "I guess you're right."
    I begin to lift myself from the armchair, ready to leave.
</p>

<p>
    "No!" Tess stands up. "Marty, don't play games with us. We know you grabbed the pendant as soon as Jamie told you it wasn't ordinary.
    What did you do with it?"
    She walks right up to Marty's desk, standing over him.
</p>

<p>
    Marty glares at her, before raising his hands from the desk.
</p>

<p>
    "Listen, I'm a pretty nice guy. And I don't like to admonish my employees…"
</p>

<p>The room is silent.</p>

<p>
    "…so, in the interest of transparency, I'll show you where I've kept it. Hopefully you'll understand why something like this needs to be kept in secure conditions."
</p>

<p>
    Marty stands, and motions to a door in the back corner of the room, one that I didn't even realize was there until now.
    Fidgeting with his keychain, he pulls out a silver key and inserts it into the lock.
    He gestures for us to enter.
</p>

<p>
    "This is our specialty storage."
    He reveals the interior, a dark but fairly spacious interior with multiple shelves.
    I enter slowly, Tess behind me; Marty props the door open behind us.
</p>

<p>
    "This is where I kept the pendant. Things here aren't ordinary valuables — this space is reserved for our most, ah,
    <em>esteemed</em>
    clients."
</p>

<p>"Which one is it in?"</p>

<p>
    "Back shelf, top row, left side. But I'd suggest you don't go over and get it."
</p>

<p>"Why not? What good is it gonna do abandoned in a dark room?"</p>

<p>
    "Well, as you said, it could be stolen, or something dangerous could happen. I'm sure that won't happen when it's in our hands — but I'm concerned about what it could do in the possession of someone who's less responsible."
</p>

<p>"Who else would take it?" I ask.</p>

<p>
    "Mostly Mr. Hawthorne and his goons. They seize any property that's not perfectly indexed and recorded."
</p>

<p>"Who's Mr. Hawthorne?"</p>

<p>"The landlord."</p>
